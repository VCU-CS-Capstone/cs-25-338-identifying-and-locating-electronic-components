# Status Reports Folder
Weekly status reports go into this folder

This Readme.md serves as the front page of this folder - update the table with very succinct weekly reports.

Project Plan.md is a document that should be updated accordingly as the project develops through the year.

Status Report Fall Week XX.md is a template for to copy-paste into new Status reports you generate every week.
