# Status Reports Folder
Weekly status reports go into this folder

This Readme.md serves as the front page of this folder - update the table with very succinct weekly reports.

Project Plan.md is a document that should be updated accordingly as the project develops through the year.

Status Report Fall Week XX.md is a template for to copy-paste into new Status reports you generate every week.

## Fall Semester

| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments | Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | Meet with Advisor to outline the project parameters | Completed and turned in Team Contract and had initial contact with Advisor | Having direction from our Advisor and point of contact |
| Week 2 Status Report | Work with AutoCAD and pytorch for designated people to gain familiarity | Meet with Advisor and established workflow and meeting times | the steep hill that is learning pytorch and AutoCAD along with implementing circuit diagrams |
| Week 3 Status Report | Continue familiarization and research into Pytorch and the surrounding aspects of our project | set outlines for project scope, aspiration, and goals | coming to a concensus on the scope of our project what will be put into the proposal |
| Week 4 Status Report | Work on proposal and continue working with Pytorch and AutoCAD | Presented to advisor our work over 2 weeks, made progress on creating diagrams and a sample model in Pytorch | Understanding the proposal in detail |
| Week 5 Status Report | Ask professor for clarification on proposal and continue working on Pytorch and designing more diagrams in AutoCAD | Finish with most of the proposal | Confusion on some parts of the proposal |
| Week 6 Status Report | Met with professor reguarding the team proposal to make sure we are following the requirements of it correctly before final submission | Completed the Team Proposal document required by thie friday | Finding the way for us to achieve the 1000+ images for the model to train on |
| Week 7 Status Report | work on developing more diagrams and training the model on these diagrams to confirm them | focused on midterms for classes and did little work on the actual project | not many to mention, more just finding time to work on it during the busy part of the semester |
| Week 8 Status Report | get the basic work on the poster done and progress further on the development of our ML algorithm | Talked with professor on how to implement the labels on our diagrams | exactly what should be done for the presentation portion of this semester |
| Week 9 Status Report | Worked on new ML model to test other implementations and mapped out whats needed for the poster | developed a separate basic model to tests on images | Not understanding where our advisor wants us to develop our algorithms |
| Week 10 Status Report | Discussed and plan out project poster and assigned tasks for different sections of the poster for each member. | Clarify with advisor on how to improve our diagrams and models. | Determine how we want to collaborately work on the poster. |
| Week 11 Status Report | Reorganized files to show labels for development and got new direwction on how to approach the diagram testing | All diagram files are up to date with the proper formatting | Understanding how to make a component of a line |
| Week 12 Status Report | Meeting with professor on the method of labeling images for training purposes | made a decision on which ML model to be used | the exact structure of the folders for training the model |
| Week 13 Status Report | Presented poster, finished the preliminary design report |keep making diagrams and training model |finalizing our model and how we want to label our diagrams |

## Spring Semester

| Document | Tasks | Accomplishments| Issues |
|---|---|---|---|
| Week 1 Status Report | produce more diagrams for testing purposes and grow data set using outside open source resources | produced next round of diagrams to add for data set | not able to produce enough diagrams ourselves for required amount |
| Week 2 Status Report | Shift Focused to finding and developing diagrams faster as possible | researched for open-source datasets for training purposes | Unable to find datasets in which we could use for training |
| Week 3 Status Report | Keep searching for more ways to fasten the diagram creation | shared autocad file for opportunity to create diagrams on one collective file| Still unable to find datasets in which we could use for training |
| Week 4 Status Report | Clarified the deliverables for the project in its current state to reorganize where we are | provided stats on how our model is running to group members | size needed for dataset is still up in the air |
| Week 5 Status Report | built scripts to automate diagram creation | generate diagrams with python file for our dataset and relabel diagrams for the LLM | creating the script for the python diagram |
| Week 6 Status Report | created more diagram using the python script | relabel diagrams for the model and create more diagrams that the model can use | increasing the accuracy of our model using the generated diagrams |
| Week 7 Status Report | running tests on new datasets to see where we are at now | Created a sutiable sized dataset collection for initial testing purposes | Long period of waiting ofr single epochs to be completed |
| Week 8 Status Report | keep tweaking hyperparameters for model, display accuracy value, and finish canvas github assignment | created powerpoint for an outline on our progress with the model and made strides in making our model more accurate | no issues at the moment |
| Week 9 Status Report | built up the dataset further | test new methods and tweaks to parameters for the model | reaching the set goal for accuracy value |
| Week 10 Status Report | achieved a 70% value for accuracy | obtain that 80% accuracy value needed | get project scope information for the rest of the semester |
| Week 11 Status Report | filled out abstract | finialize what we want to present on our expo poster | nothing at the moment, just keep preparing for expo |
| Week 12 Status Report | meet with advisor to finalize our project work for the semester | finished expo poster and abstract | getting in contact with our advisor |
| Week 13 Status Report | | | |
| Week 14 Status Report | | | |
| Week 15 Status Report | | | |
| Week 16 Status Report | | | |
